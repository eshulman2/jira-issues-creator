# Jira Issues Creator

Jira Issues Creator automates the creation of epics, stories, tasks, and sub-tasks in Jira using structured YAML configuration files. It eliminates manual data entry and ensures consistency through predefined configurations.

For questions, feature requests, or to report issues, please visit our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/imatza-rh/jira-issues-creator/issues). We welcome your feedback and suggestions!

## Motivation

Managing complex Jira projects often involves creating nested issues like epics, stories, tasks, and sub-tasks. Manual setup can be time-consuming and error-prone. Jira Issues Creator addresses these challenges by automating the process, ensuring efficiency and accuracy through:

- **Templating and Routines**: Streamline recurring tasks with stored templates, reducing manual effort.
- **Procedures and Documentation**: Facilitate Jira issue creation for procedures and documentation using predefined files, which is useful during meetings or planning sessions.
- **Automation**: Simplify issue creation and configure fields like story points, sprints, and links after initial issue creation.

## Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Authenticates with Jira using API tokens.
- **Custom Field Mapping**: Maps Jiraâ€™s custom fields to your project needs.
- **YAML-Based Automation**: Automates complex issue structures with YAML files.
- **Post-Creation Configuration**: Sets additional fields after issue creation.
- **Version Control**: Store configuration files in source control for version tracking and integrity.
